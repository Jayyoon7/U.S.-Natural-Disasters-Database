# 🌪️ U.S. Natural Disasters Database

This project was developed as part of the **Database Design and Modeling** course at the **University of Maryland** during the Fall 2022 semester. The goal was to create a well-structured relational database using **MySQL** to store and analyze information about recent natural disasters in the United States.

## 📚 Project Overview

Working in a team of three students, we designed and implemented a comprehensive database system centered on U.S. natural disasters. The project involved:

- Designing an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- Building the database schema in **MySQL**
- Collecting and inserting disaster-related data
- Writing complex **SQL queries** to explore and analyze trends and patterns

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL**: For database creation, management, and querying
- **SQL**: For data manipulation and analysis

## 🧩 Features

- **Normalized database schema** to support efficient storage and querying
- Analysis-ready tables covering:
  - Disaster type (e.g., hurricane, wildfire, flood)
  - Location details (state, region)
  - Damage estimates, casualties, and response metrics
- Sample queries to extract meaningful insights:
  - Most frequent types of disasters by region
  - Total damage costs over time
  - Trends in disaster frequency year-over-year

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

- Applied **relational database design** principles to a real-world dataset
- Gained hands-on experience with **MySQL** and structured querying
- Learned the importance of **team coordination**, role division, and iterative development in database projects
- Enhanced skills in **data modeling, data normalization, and analytical querying**
